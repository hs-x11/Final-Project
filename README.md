# Final-Project

Hello, Group 3,

Good work on this project. I like the right-aligned navbar as well as the logo that you left-aligned in that same space. Your site is laid out well which makes it easy to navigate, as well as find what you are looking for. Your code is written well and I like that it has a clean layout which makes it easy to read through the code and identify the different sections that you have. I like the search bar that you created as well as the contact page with a functioning form for inputs. Your style is consistent throughout the page as well. 
Some notes I have are on the Home page the "Anna Makes It" text and the description text below that overlap a bit. Also, your Testimonials and Pricing page files are empty but I saw that you wanted to use those as placeholders.
